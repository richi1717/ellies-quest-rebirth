<h2>Ellie's Quest Rebirth</h2>

<p>This is a redo of my final project for Rockit Bootcamp where I made a final fantasy like turn based rpg with javascript and backbone.  I have since learned React and would like to try to rewrite this using react.  Feel free to clone, fork, hit me up, or do some pull requests.  I want to do this and then actually turn this into a nice working game:)</p>

### Installation

First clone this project 

```
$ git clone git@github.com:richi1717/ellies-quest-rebirth.git
```

Then

```
$ npm i
```

If you do not have webpack and webpack-dev-server installed globally do it now

```
$ npm i -g webpack webpack-dev-server
```

Then finally 

```
$ npm start
```

Then go to http://localhost:8080/ in chrome (because honestly that's the only one I've tested in right now) and enjoy.

### Insight

As you can clearly tell this is a huge project.  The original that I did was poorly written as it was the first project I'd ever written by myself.  Now I've gotten a few projects done and have a much better understanding of the tools I am using.  I want to do this right and honestly have fun with it.  At the point of writing this I have only worked on the battle scene and have hard coded certain pieces just for testing.  I've commented out the music for the battles, haven't even worked on triggering the battles, have hard coded the forest as my battle scene, and when you win the battle the only thing that happens is a div pops up with the words `You Win!!!` above the hero's head.  I also, to save time and test, have only been using the one character.  Eventually I'd like to get more characters in as well.  I know React was not created with the thought of making games and honestly I will probably never create games for a living, but pushing the tools beyond what they were intended helps me to get a solid grasp of how to use the tools the right way.  The more I use them the more I am confident in my skills and have a ton of fun working with it.  I love React.  It is the most fun I've had programming and I learn more about it each time I want to accomplish something new in my game.  When I go to work and work on projects for them I find that I know exactly what to do because of the effort I've put into this.  So while maybe it wasn't meant to do this, it sure helps me learn it.  I also have to say that Immutable.js, while the docs may be confusing to read at first, is an amazing tool that ensures you aren't mutating your data and you can be confident that when you make a change it isn't going to cause you headaches down the road.  So if anyone can learn from this and would like to help I'd be happy to speak with you.  Hope this gets finished some day where people can play it and enjoy it as much as I have.
